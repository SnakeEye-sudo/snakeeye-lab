## 📋 What is SnakeEye Lab?

SnakeEye Lab is a **structured portfolio project** designed to:

1. **Track meaningful skill progression** through monthly themes
2. **Build only high-quality, polished projects** (not random experiments)
3. **Demonstrate deliberate learning** to recruiters and collaborators
4. **Create a narrative** of systematic growth across full-stack development

Each month focuses on a specific domain. Each theme includes 1-2 production-ready projects that showcase core competencies.

## 🎯 What Gets Built Each Month

### Project Types

**Showcase Project**: 1 polished, fully-featured app
- Demo-ready
- Full documentation
- Production code quality
- Live link (via Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

**Exploration Project**: 1-2 smaller experiments
- Focused learning
- May be more experimental
- Clear README explaining concepts

---

## ✨ Key Principles

1. **Deliberate, Not Random**  
   Every month has a clear learning goal. Projects directly serve that goal.

2. **Polished Over Quantity**  
   1-2 finished projects beat 5 half-baked ideas.

3. **No External API Dependency**  
   Core logic is yours. Focus on understanding fundamentals.

4. **Documentation First**  
   Each project includes README, setup guide, and architecture notes.

5. **Visible Progress**  
   Live links, screenshots, and case studies make your work accessible.

## 📖 Getting Started

### How to Use This Repo

1. **Explore monthly folders** to see what's being built
2. **Read project READMEs** for architecture & learning notes
3. **Check ROADMAP.md** for detailed monthly breakdowns
4. **View GALLERY.md** for live links and demos

### To Run Any Project

Each project has its own setup in its README:

```bash
cd 2025-12-zero-api-web/project-1
cat README.md  # Read setup instructions
# Follow the steps (usually just: open index.html or npm install + npm start)
```

## 💡 Philosophy

This lab exists because:

- **Random GitHub activity isn't memorable**
- **A coherent narrative is**
- **Recruiters want to see systematic growth**
- **Building the same skill in different contexts is how mastery happens**

Every project answers: *What did I learn? Why? How does it connect to my growth as an engineer?*
